      at https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine-windows

        * configure.py: Exiting properly on both Cygwin and NetBSD.
            See https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine/issues/7
    0.3.14
        * INSTALL.Haiku: Terminal bug has been fixed.
        * README:
            - Added Haiku as a tested platform.
            - Added note about $TERM on NetBSD.
    0.3.13
        * BUGS: Removed problematic platform #2 (openindiana)
        * README:
            - Anonymine is it's name now.  Name suggestions are no
              longer welcome
            - Delayed mouse support to 0.5.z
            - Edited the features list
        * HACKING:
            - Updates to file list
            - Removed Windows stuff section
            - Added note about make uninstall
            - Documented enginecfg.default
    0.3.12
        * configure.py: Use `sys.exit` instead of `os._exit` as the latter
            caused weird issues with stream redirection.
    0.3.11
        * README: http://anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:8080/ link removed.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.input): The redrawing of the screen after
            initialization never worked as the game status got changed.
            Junk on the screen from impatient players will now be cleared.
        * INSTALL.Haiku: Use env(1) instead of setting and resetting $TERM.
        * desktop/*: Brief descriptions.
    0.3.10
        * desktop/anonymine.v0.xcf: Gone.
        * Makefile.static:
            - Was still looking for name suggestions...
            - Sections are now clearer.
        * mkdist, Makefile.static: Simplify code now when Windows support is
            gone.
    0.3.9
        * Forgotten Windows stuff, minor style fixes.
    0.3.8
        *: Removed Windows support.  (Going to create that in a different
            repo.)

        * anonymine.py, cursescfg: Calculate pair numbers automatically.
    0.3.5
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores): Python 2.6 incompatibilities fixed:
            - str.format can't handle empty field names ('{}')
            - str.decode takes no keyword arguments
    0.3.4
        * cursescfg: Use reverse video for the flags to make them more
            distinguishable on monochrome terminals.
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)): Failed to set
            display_caption when the player didn't make it to highscores.
        * Makefile.static: Added distclean.
    0.3.3
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)): list.index does not
            return None, but raises ValueError. Plus various changes for
            the fix.

        * anonymine.py (ask): Do no more than 10 000 000 attempts on EINTR
            handling.

        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores, game_engine (play_game)):
            Added highscores for lost games.
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field (_call)): Check that won games
            really are won, any defect will automatically turn
            'win' into 'lose'.
        * anonymine.py (output): Do no more than 10 000 000 attempts.
    0.3.0
