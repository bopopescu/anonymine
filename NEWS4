What's new in 0.4.0 since 0.3.0?
================================
    
    - Tidied up
        - Several changes to INSTALL, README and HACKING
        - Removed BUGS.  Issues have been created on Github and the workarounds
          have been documented.
        - Added a new question to and reordered FAQ.
    
    - Dropped Windows support in version 0.3.8. Windows support can be found
      at https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine-windows
    
    - Introduced the losers' highscores in version 0.3.1
    
    - New textics since version 0.3.6 (small fix in 0.3.7)

    0.3.15
        * configure.py: Exiting properly on both Cygwin and NetBSD.
            See https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine/issues/7
    0.3.12
        * configure.py: Use `sys.exit` instead of `os._exit` as the latter
            caused weird issues with stream redirection.
    0.3.11
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.input): The redrawing of the screen after
            initialization never worked as the game status got changed.
            Junk on the screen from impatient players will now be cleared.
    0.3.6
        * anonymine.py, cursescfg: Calculate pair numbers automatically.
    0.3.5
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores): Python 2.6 incompatibilities fixed:
            - str.format can't handle empty field names ('{}')
            - str.decode takes no keyword arguments
    0.3.4
        * cursescfg: Use reverse video for the flags to make them more
            distinguishable on monochrome terminals.
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)): Failed to set
            display_caption when the player didn't make it to highscores.
    0.3.3
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)): list.index does not
            return None, but raises ValueError. Plus various changes for
            the fix.
    0.3.1
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores, game_engine (play_game)):
            Added highscores for lost games.
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field (_call)): Check that won games
            really are won, any defect will automatically turn
            'win' into 'lose'.
