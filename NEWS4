What's new in 0.4.0 since 0.3.0?
================================
    
    - Tidied up
        - Several changes to INSTALL, README and HACKING
        - Removed BUGS.  Issues have been created on Github and the workarounds
          have been documented.
        - Added a new question to and reordered FAQ.
    
    - Dropped Windows support in version 0.3.8. Windows support can be found
      at https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine-windows
    
    - Introduced the losers' highscores in version 0.3.1 (bugfix in 0.3.3)
    
    - New textics since version 0.3.6 (small fix in 0.3.7)
    
    - The format of cursescfg was changed in 0.3.6: the pair numbers have
      been removed as they are now calculated automatically.
      Older cursescfg's are incompatible.
    
    - Bugfixes
    
    0.3.15 + 0.3.12
        * configure.py: Exiting properly on both Cygwin and NetBSD.
            See https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine/issues/7
    0.3.11
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.input): The redrawing of the screen after
            initialization never worked as the game status got changed.
            Junk on the screen from impatient players will now be cleared.
    0.3.4
        * cursescfg: Use reverse video for the flags to make them more
            distinguishable on monochrome terminals.
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field (_call)): Check that won games
            really are won, any defect will automatically turn
            'win' into 'lose'.
