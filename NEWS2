Installation:
    *       Makefile.static has had some serious clean up, including:
                - Using Makefile as a makefile rather than a batch job
                - Renamed variables
                - Moved quatation marks from variable definitions to invocation.
                - `make verbose=false`

    0.1.15  Changes to configure
                - Prohibit quotes in variables and $() in their names.
        * configure.py (getargs): Less misleading error messages when
            arguments don't make sense.
                - Don't crash when there were errors in verbose mode.
                - Use $PAGER and pager(1) if available.


    0.1.21
        * anonymine_engine.py: New class: security_alert.
            - DoS prevention by field area and initialization time.
                (Raises new class security_alert).
            - Removed timeout from initialization slaves to improve
                initialization on larger (emphasis on comparative) fields.
            - Removed key: 'init-field'.'maxtime' (and the code for it)
            - Added keys: 'init-field'.'sec-maxarea' and
                'init-field'.'sec-maxtime'
