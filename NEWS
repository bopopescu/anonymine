    *       Makefile.static has had some serious clean up, including:
                - Using Makefile as a makefile rather than a batch job
                - Renamed variables
                - Moved quatation marks from variable definitions to
                  invocation.

                - Use $PAGER and pager(1) if available.

0.1.19 to 0.1.21 - DoS protection:
    - DoS prevention by field area and initialization time.
    - Removed timeout from initialization slaves to improve the
      initialization time on larger (emphasis on comparative) fields.
    - This introduced incompatibilities to the configuration file.
    - Uses mkenginecfg to set the number of slave processes in the
      enginecfg configuration file
