What's new in 0.3.0 since 0.2.0?
================================

    Highscores:
        - Implemented: 0.2.3
        - Usable since: 0.2.16
        - With less(1): 0.2.26
        - Security fix: 0.2.31, 0.2.25 to 0.2.30 are vulnerable.
        - Latest update: 0.2.32
        - Introduced a change to cursescfg and the interface's
          display function.
    
    0.2.30
        * README: It works again on Minix 3.3 and openindiana.
        * configure.py [openindiana]: INSTALL_CMD was changed to INSTALL in
            Makefile.static at version 0.1.17.  I forgot to change it in
            configure.py as well.
        * INSTALL: Added "INSTALL" as a recognized variable
        * anonymine_engine.py [Minix]: Guess what, Python 2.7 on Minix 3.3
            has no math module. Created a really dumb replacement.
        * anonymine.py [Minix]: Can't import subprocess either. Piping to
            less will fail, but that's a tolerable error.
    0.2.28
        * (All python modules): Allow running as root on Haiku.
        *: New file INSTALL.Haiku.
        *: Moved Windows.txt to INSTALL.Windows to match the new pattern.
    0.2.27
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations): Fixed syntax error.
        * Makefile.static (release): Added verbose messages, added new
            target "test" as a synonym for "check".
    0.2.26
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display):
            - Add -# 1 as options to less.
            - Allow subprocess to fail.
        * README: Added some notes about the tested platforms.
            Minix 3 and openindiana no longer work.
        * mkenginexfg:
            - seq(1) is apparently a GNU specific utility.
            - Added quotes around $nproc to let the Python script succeed
              even if no method of counting processors worked.
    0.2.25
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display): Use less(1).
    0.2.24
        * anonymine_solver.py: Removed deprecated functions.
        * README: Dropped goal 0.5: statistics module. Rephrased 0.6(->0.5)
        * test.py: Removed functions that depend on the deprecated statistics
            functions.
    0.2.23
        *: New file: HACKING, RELEASE-NOTES
        * README: Moved file listing to HACKING.
        * Makefile.static: $$ doesn't work on FreeBSD's make, it needs to be
            $$$$ which doesn't work on gmake.
            - Created a small shellscript to be invoked from `make dist`.
            - Hard coded the icons sizes. Ugh.
        * Makefile.static ($(MAIN_STAGE)): Depend on Makefile.static to
            force the correct version number.
        * Makefile.static (dist): Don't depend on zip and tarballs. Doing
            that will cause issues with parallel make.
        * Makefile.static, configure.py, RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL: Changed the
            values for freedesktop, macosx and windows to the unambiguous true
            or false.
    0.2.22
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (display)): Www HH:MM goes back to
            six days; Added "(Future)"
        * configure.py, Makefile.static, anonymine.py, INSTALL: Allow
            $(sysconfdir) to be anything.
        * INSTALL: Modified.
    0.2.21
        * Makefile.static, anonymine.py, configure: Moved version numbering
            into Makefile.static only to simplify version bumping.
    0.2.20
        * cursescfg:  Difficult to see anything in B&W mode: Change '?' to '.'
            to increase the visual difference between flags and free cells.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match these changes:
        * Makefile.static: Disabled overwrite-cfg due to the new behavior
            of check-install-cfg.
        * install-cfg:
            - Wrote docstrings
            - Changed return values for `decide`
            - Tell which configuration file is incompatible and refer to the
              source file.
        * install-cfg, Configuration files: Added support for a status quo
            marker line.  If the magic line can be found in the destination
            file, it will be overwritten.
        * install-cfg, Makefile.static (check-install-cfg): Send the verbose
            variable to ./install-cfg to make it shut up if it has nothing
            exceptional to say.
    0.2.19
        * cursescfg: Hexagonal grid was still too bright -> set to A_DIM,
            text does not need to be bright.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): Fixed double-prompt for nickname.
    0.2.18
        * anonymine.py, BUGS: Got away with only redrawing on the first click
            (initialization).  This was previously a potential performance
            issue.
        * cursescfg: Bright/bold magenta was too bright for the hexagonal grid.
    0.2.17
        * BUGS, anonymine.py: #9, use a different fix.
            - `ask` modified to handle EINTR
            - New function `output` created as wrapper.
            - Added 'str' as paramtype to `convert_param`
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.init_field2):
            - Handle EINTR on os.wait, os.fork already does this
              unintentionally.
            - raise security_alert rather than Exception for the timeout alarm.
              (except Exception caught lots of other stuff.)
        * anonymine.py: Use str(game_engine.security_alert) rather than
            game_engine.security_alert.message.
        * BUGS: Added note about #3
        * mkenginecfg, enginecfg.default: sec-maxtime: 90 -> 900
    0.2.16
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores), etc: Force UTF-8 on the file.
            - Functions may return unicode objects as strings on Python 2, but
              that's no problem as unicode and str can be combined as long as
              the str only contains bytes in the ASCII range.
            - add_entry, will decode the str object on Python 2 using
              locale.getprefferedencoding() as encoding
            - The maxsize key now refers to the number of bytes on both
              Pythons.
            - Added a nick-maxlen key to limit the length of nicknames.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): sys.stdin.readline may raise
            UnicodeDecodeError on Python 3. Grr.
        * anonymine_engine.py (init_field2): open(file, 'x') raised ValueError
            on Python 3.2, **try** 'wx' and then 'x', and if both fail, 'w'.
        * mkenginecfg, enginecfg.default: entries set to 16, previously: 10
    0.2.15
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations): \t doesn't work on FreeBSD;
            indented manually with normal whitespace instead.
    0.2.14
        * Makefile.static: Undo change in 0.2.9 causing configuration files
            to not be installed in clean environments:
            - install-dirs now installs CFG_DIR and $(DESTDIR)$(vargamesdir)
            Apparently, install
    0.2.13
        * configure.py: BUGFIX in many find_ functions:
            Don't use Makefile[var] for checking the existence of directories,
            use expand(var, Makefile) instead.  Detected on FreeBSD where
            $(prefix)/var both exists and doesn't.
    0.2.12
        * INSTALL:
            - Tidying.
            - Wrote a section on srcdir, builddir and DESTDIR.
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations):
            - Highscores file
            - Append (directory) on directory lines.
    0.2.11
        *: Tidied up lots of files.
        * BUGS:
            - Updated #6 to match current versions of Anonymine.
            - Tidied
            - Removed #0
        * configure.py:  Wrote missing doc-strings.
        * configure.py:  Moved default Makefile variables from getargs to main.
    0.2.10
        * anonymine_engine.py (init_field2):
            - Use SIGTERM to kill children if SIGCONT is unavailable.
            - Allow fork() to fail.
            - Use signal.alarm() in a more elegant way.
            - Add 64 bits of entropy to the tempfiles, just in case
              open(file, 'wx') fails to do its trick.

        * Makefile.static:
            - Added DESTDIR to HISCORE_FILE
            - install-dirs now installs CFG_DIR and $(DESTDIR)$(vargamesdir)
    0.2.8
        * configure.py: New functions: find_sysconfdir and find_vargamesdir.
        * anonymine.py, configure.py, Makefile.static: Place configuration

        * mkenginecfg: Write out the configuration file manually.
    0.2.7
        * anonymine_engine.py anonymine.py: Python 3 fixes:
            - anonymine_engine.hiscores.display.format_deltatime formatted
              the ms part as gibberish. [Fixed]
            - anonymine.play_game, anonymine.highscores_add_entry did not
              flush. [Fixed]
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (display)): "/\T" -> "/\T time"
    0.2.6
        * anonymine.py: New functions highscores_display and
            highscores_add_entry.  Highscores are now displayed
            almost properly.
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores_dummy (display)): Title no longer empty.
    0.2.5
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores.add_entry): Reload the hiscores file
            after retrieving the nickname to avoid overwriting potential
            changes.
    0.2.4
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores):  Get the nickname only if the player
            actually made it to the list.
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (add_entry)):  The input callback MUST
            now take two arguments: title, prompt
        * anonymine.py: Input callback updated.

2016-07-13      Oskar Skog      <oskar.skog.finland@gmail.com>
    0.2.3
        * anonymine.py: Primitive highscores interface for debugging purposes.
        * anonymine_engine.py: New classes: hiscores, hiscores_dummy
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine (play_game)): Create a `hiscores`
            object.
            Second return argument is now a `hiscores` object, previously
            it was a float representing the time it took to win or lose.
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine (__init__)): Added self.dimensions
            and self.flagcount to allow `play_game` to create a proper
            paramstring for hiscores.__init__.


2016-07-07      Oskar Skog      <oskar.skog.finland@gmail.com>
    0.2.2
        * mkenginecfg: Bugfix:
            `nonexisting-cpulister | wc -l` returns 0 processors
            and succeeds.
            - Fixed the pipelines.
            - Added a sanity check.
        * configure.py: Fix verbosity setting for Makefile.
            Give Makefile verbose=false as default and verbose=true
            if the -v flag was used.
        * Makefile.static (overwrite-cfg):
            Use $(info) instead of echo.
        * Makefile.static (dist, tarballs, zip):
            Don't bother writing out the "Depends on tarballs and zip"
            message as that itself depends on those two targets.
            Messages are now printed by zip and tarballs.
