    Build system and package files:
        HACKING         0.2.23
        RELEASE-NOTES   0.2.23
        make test       0.2.27
    
    0.2.24
        * anonymine_solver.py: Removed deprecated functions.
        * README: Dropped goal 0.5: statistics module. Rephrased 0.6(->0.5)
        * test.py: Removed functions that depend on the deprecated statistics
            functions.
    
    0.2.23
        *: New file: HACKING, RELEASE-NOTES
        * Makefile.static ($(MAIN_STAGE)): Depend on Makefile.static to
            force the correct version number.
        * Makefile.static, configure.py, RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL: Changed the
            values for freedesktop, macosx and windows to the unambiguous true
            or false.
    0.2.22
        * configure.py, Makefile.static, anonymine.py, INSTALL: Allow
            $(sysconfdir) to be anything.
        * INSTALL: Modified.
    0.2.21
        * Makefile.static, anonymine.py, configure: Moved version numbering
            into Makefile.static only to simplify version bumping.
    0.2.20
        * cursescfg:  Difficult to see anything in B&W mode: Change '?' to '.'
            to increase the visual difference between flags and free cells.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match these changes:
        * Makefile.static: Disabled overwrite-cfg due to the new behavior
            of check-install-cfg.
        * install-cfg:
            - Wrote docstrings
            - Changed return values for `decide`
            - Tell which configuration file is incompatible and refer to the
              source file.
        * install-cfg, Configuration files: Added support for a status quo
            marker line.  If the magic line can be found in the destination
            file, it will be overwritten.
        * install-cfg, Makefile.static (check-install-cfg): Send the verbose
            variable to ./install-cfg to make it shut up if it has nothing
            exceptional to say.
    0.2.19
        * cursescfg: Hexagonal grid was still too bright -> set to A_DIM,
            text does not need to be bright.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): Fixed double-prompt for nickname.
    0.2.18
        * anonymine.py, BUGS: Got away with only redrawing on the first click
            (initialization).  This was previously a potential performance
            issue.
        * cursescfg: Bright/bold magenta was too bright for the hexagonal grid.
    0.2.17
        * BUGS, anonymine.py: #9, use a different fix.
            - `ask` modified to handle EINTR
            - New function `output` created as wrapper.
            - Added 'str' as paramtype to `convert_param`
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.init_field2):
            - Handle EINTR on os.wait, os.fork already does this
              unintentionally.
            - raise security_alert rather than Exception for the timeout alarm.
              (except Exception caught lots of other stuff.)
        * anonymine.py: Use str(game_engine.security_alert) rather than
            game_engine.security_alert.message.
        * BUGS: Added note about #3
        * mkenginecfg, enginecfg.default: sec-maxtime: 90 -> 900
    0.2.15
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations): \t doesn't work on FreeBSD;
            indented manually with normal whitespace instead.
    0.2.14
        * Makefile.static: Undo change in 0.2.9 causing configuration files
            to not be installed in clean environments:
            - install-dirs now installs CFG_DIR and $(DESTDIR)$(vargamesdir)
            Apparently, install
    0.2.13
        * configure.py: BUGFIX in many find_ functions:
            Don't use Makefile[var] for checking the existence of directories,
            use expand(var, Makefile) instead.  Detected on FreeBSD where
            $(prefix)/var both exists and doesn't.
    0.2.12
        * INSTALL:
            - Tidying.
            - Wrote a section on srcdir, builddir and DESTDIR.
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations):
            - Highscores file
            - Append (directory) on directory lines.
    0.2.11
        *: Tidied up lots of files.
        * BUGS:
            - Updated #6 to match current versions of Anonymine.
            - Tidied
            - Removed #0
        * configure.py:  Wrote missing doc-strings.
        * configure.py:  Moved default Makefile variables from getargs to main.
    
    0.2.9
        * INSTALL: Updated
        * enginecfg.default: Added the hiscores key.
        * cygwin-sshd:
            - Added "Things that will be done:" to avoid confusion.
            - exit 0 instead of fatal if the user aborts.
        * Makefile.static:
            - install-dirs now installs CFG_DIR and $(DESTDIR)$(vargamesdir)
    0.2.8
        * configure.py: New functions: find_sysconfdir and find_vargamesdir.
        * anonymine.py, configure.py, Makefile.static: Place configuration
            files in $(sysconfdir)/anonymine
        * Makefile.static: enginecfg calibration message updated.
        * mkenginecfg: Write out the configuration file manually.
    0.2.2
        * mkenginecfg: Bugfix:
            `nonexisting-cpulister | wc -l` returns 0 processors
            and succeeds.
            - Fixed the pipelines.
            - Added a sanity check.
        * configure.py: Fix verbosity setting for Makefile.
            Give Makefile verbose=false as default and verbose=true
            if the -v flag was used.
        * Makefile.static (overwrite-cfg):
            Use $(info) instead of echo.

    *       Makefile.static has had some serious clean up, including:
                - Using Makefile as a makefile rather than a batch job
                - Renamed variables
                - Moved quatation marks from variable definitions to
                  invocation.

    - DoS prevention by field area and initialization time.

      initialization time on larger (emphasis on comparative) fields.
    - This introduced incompatibilities to the configuration file.
    - Uses mkenginecfg to set the number of slave processes in the
      enginecfg configuration file
