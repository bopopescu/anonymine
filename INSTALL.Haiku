I haven't yet figured out how to get it installed on Haiku, but it plays
acceptably well.   The terminal unfortunately screws up the screen quite
often, disabling color helps though.

(Tested on Haiku nightly build hrev50483.)

To "install" it
$ git clone https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine.git
$ cd anonymine
$ touch highscores
$ ./mkenginecfg ./ ./ highscores

To play it
$ cd anonymine
$ env TERM=vt100 python anonymine.py -c cursescfg -e enginecfg.out
