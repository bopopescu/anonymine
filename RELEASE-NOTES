0.4.8
    - PyPy will be used instead of CPython if possible.
    - New Makefile/configure variable: "python" the path to the desired
      Python interpreter.
    - MODULES_OTHERVER has been removed from configure and Makefile.
    - If you have PyPy installed, you should run
        ./configure -v # DESTDIR=foo
        make  # Needs to have the same DESTDIR as `make install`.
        sudo make install
        sudo python symlinks install    # in $(builddir)
        sudo python symlinks uninstall  # in $(builddir)

0.4.5 - 0.4.7
    - Avoid 0.4.5 and 0.4.6, use 0.4.7 instead, the issues #16 and #17 were
      not fixed correctly.
        - If you already had one of them, run
            ./configure -v && make
          to fix the issues in the previous versions.
    - `make` makes Makefile, you should only have to run `./configure` once.
    - Do not send 'srcdir' and 'builddir' to `make`.
    - `make install` depends on `make all`.

      You can find an untested Windows version at
      https://github.com/oskar-skog/anonymine-windows

0.3.6
    - cursescfg: color pair number are calculated automatically.
      The textics tuples are now (char, foreground, background, attributes)
