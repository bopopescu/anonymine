WINDOWS USERS
=============

    Read "Windows.txt" instead.


DEPENDENCIES
============

    * Python >= 2.6 (3.x allowed)
    * The curses module. (Python bindings for curses.)
    * A screen size of at least 10 columns by 8 rows.
        (7 by 4 for non-hexagonal gametypes.)
    * A unix-like operating system or the argparse module.
    
    Normal installation will only work on unix-like operating
    systems.
    
    On unix-unlike systems you must specify the location of both
    configuration files, which is why the argparse module would
    be required on a non-nix platform.


PROPER INSTALLATION
===================

    In the directory extracted from the tarball, run:
        ./configure
        make
        make install        # as root
    
    Use "./configure -v" to make the whole installation process verbose.

    NOTICE:
        The system-wide configuration files for the game will only be created
        if they do not exist.  `make install` will fail if the format of the
        configuration has changed and old configuration files exist.
        
        To force an overwrite of the system-wide configuration files, run
        `make overwrite-cfg`.  If you do this because of a failed make install,
        run make install again.

    Anonymine will be installed as 'anonymine'.
    
    You may want to make some changes to '$(sysconfdir)/anonymine/enginecfg'.
    Run "make print-destinations" to find out where files will be installed.


RUN IN CURRENT DIRECTORY
========================

    You can run Anonymine right here in this directory (the directory) of the
    package.
    
    python anonymine.py -c cursescfg -e enginecfg.default


ADVANCED INSTALLATION
=====================
    
    Important notes
    ===============
    
        * Anonymine expects to be run by "python", not "python2.7" etc; Make
        sure you have those symlinks.
        * The other version of python is expected to by "python3" or
        "python2"; make sure you have that symlink as well if you want the
        modules to be installed for both versions.
        * enginecfg is auto-generated since 0.1.19, you can override the file
        by creating `$(builddir)enginecfg.user` as your own enginecfg.
    
    
    ./configure; make; make install
    ===============================
    
        ./configure will accept variables with three different syntaxes:
            ./configure --name value
            ./configure --name=value
            ./configure name=value
        
        All variables/options require exactly one value/argument.
        All variables will also be stored in the Makefile.
        
        The value of a variable MAY be a Makefile variable/macro.
        
        The value entered on the command line will not be pre-expanded in the
        Makefile, except for "builddir" and "srcdir".  The exception is there
        to prevent issues when make is run from a different directory than
        configure.
            "srcdir" and "builddir" will automatically be converted to absolute
            paths.
        
        configure will also accept these short options:
            -f      Force; write the Makefile even if there were errors.
            -v      verbose; this also affects the Makefile
            -w      Use sys.prefix as prefix. (For quickly removing old
                    versions.)
        
        The real "configure" script will handle these:
            ./configure -h
            ./configure -V
            ./configure --help
            ./configure --version
    
    
    Recognised variables
    ====================
    
        Variable                default and/or description
        --------                --------------------------
        
        prefix                  sys.prefix

        DESTDIR                 Pretend the root is here
        srcdir                  The directory extracted from the tarball.

        windows                 Empty=false, non-empty=true; Windows (Cygwin)
        

        NOTE 1
            gamesdir will override bindir if possible, so setting bindir
            might have no effect
        
        NOTE 2
            The game itself only tests for sys.prefix+'/etc' and '/etc'.
            ./configure will fails if sysconfdir is not usable by the game.
        
        prefix, bindir and libdir, localstatedir, sysconfdir:

        DESTDIR

        srcdir and builddir
        -------------------
        
            $(srcdir) is the directory that was extracted from the tarball.
            
            $(builddir) is the directory where make(1) is allowed to create
            "temporary" files when building (`make [all]`) the program.
            
            Both of these default to the current working directory.
        
        sysconfdir
            Configuration files will be stored in $(sysconfdir)/anonymine/
        
        vargamesdir
            The highscores file is $(vargamesdir)/anonymine
        
        EXECUTABLES
        ===========
        
            This is the directory to which this game will be installed.
            
            It will be assigned to the first variable of [gamesdir, bindir]
            that expands into a path that exists in $PATH.
            
            As a consequence: The game will probably not be installed where
            you want it to if you specify bindir=somewhere-else as it installs
            to gamesdir rather than bindir (if possible).
        
        
        MODULES and MODULES_OTHERVER
        ============================
        
            As Python 3 is slightly backwards-incompatible with Python 2,
            both version may be installed.
            
            This game works with both versions of Python, and installs three
            modules that could be used by some other program.
            
            The modules will be copied to $(MODULES). And if there is another
            Python, symlinks to the installed modules will be created in
            $(MODULES_OTHERVER).
            
            The default value of MODULES and MODULES_OTHERVER is the first
            of the following that exists in sys.path:
                $(libdir)/python$(major)/site-packages
                $(libdir)/python$(major).$(minor)/site-packages
                $(libdir)/python$(major)/dist-packages
                $(libdir)/python$(major).$(minor)/dist-packages
            
            $(major) and $(minor) are pre-expanded and do NOT exist in the
            Makefile.
    
    
    srcdir, builddir and DESTDIR
    ============================
    
        srcdir          Directory extracted from the tarball.
        
        builddir        Temporary storage;
                        directory for files from the build process.
        
        DESTDIR         Prepended to all paths on install and uninstall;
                        alternative root.
        
        
        Both srcdir and builddir default to the current working directory.
        
        These three variables can be sent to either ./configure or make,
        but there are some differences between the two.
        
        ./configure will prepend variables to the Makefile which will be
        saved in builddir.
        
        Sending builddir= to ./configure will create the Makefile inside
        builddir. While if you send builddir= to make, you'll have to run
        "make builddir=foo && sudo make builddir=foo install" in the
        current directory.
    
    
    Targets in the Makefile
    =======================
    
        all (default)
            Fix the shebang line of the programs to be installed
        
        clean
            Remove stage files and bytecode.
        
        print-destinations
            Print where things will be installed.
        
        install
            Altered configuration files will not be touched by this target.
            If the existing configuration file is incompatible but does not
            identify itself as unmodified, installation will fail and the
            configuration file must be manually edited.
        
        uninstall
            This will remove the system-wide configuration files as well.
            To remove an installed version older than 0.0.31 you'll need
            to run ./configure with the -w option.
        
        check
            Check that everything seems to work.
        
        tarballs
            make tarballs
        
        zip
            NOTE: Requires unix2dos(1) and zip(1).
            Generate an archive suitable for Windrugs users.
                - zip
                - CRLF line endings
                - .txt
        
        release
            (You are me.)
        
        make dist
            'check' that I am not making an embarrassing release,
            make 'tarballs' and the 'zip' and 'release' them.
