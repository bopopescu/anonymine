                - Python 3 on NetBSD will always exit 0.
                - Python 3 on other systems that hang on exit will hang.
                - Python 2 on other systems that hang on exit will exit
                    appropriately.
                - Will exit appropriately on systems that don't hang
                    on exit.

            Don't raise SystemExit(1) on error, use os._exit() instead.
        * anonymine_fields.py: Renewed the `generic_field` class as
            _deref caused some confusion if used more than once.
            Performance is about the same.

        * anonymine.py (curses_game.input):

        * anonymine_solver.py (solver.number_neighbours):
            Only add cells to the list that are not already in it.
            Makes the solver 4x as fast.
        * anonymine_solver.py, anonymine_fields.py:
            Closer inspection of the caching of neighbours gives a speed
            multiplier of 2.5.
            The solver is now approx 10x as fast as in version 0.0.23.
    0.0.25
        * anonymine_solver.py (solver.rule9bf): The bug found at 0.0.24
            might have been found.  It was checking if a free cell was a
            neighbour to EACH unsolved cell rather than to ANY unsolved
            cell.
            I will run a bugcatcher to verify that the bug that may or may
            not exist, is very improbable to occur.

    0.0.24
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field):
            Cache the lists returned by `generic_field.get_neighbours`.
            Seems to be 2x as fast.
        * BUGS:
            While profiling, a bug was found: the solver made a mistake

    0.0.23
        * configure.py (getargs): Now works on Python 2.5.5 (which is too
            old for this game).
        * configure.py, INSTALL: Allow three flags/short options:
            -f force
            -v verbose
    0.0.22
        * configure.py, configure, INSTALL: Installation is more customisable
            with directory variables now being supported by the configure.py
            script.  srcdir, builddir, DESTDIR, prefix, bindir, gamesdir,
            libdir, EXECUTABLES, MODULES, MODULES_OTHERVER
        * configure.py: Try to get this to work on Python 2.5.
        * Makefile.static: Have 'check-install-cfg' as a dependency of
            'install' in the hope of that this will prevent installing
            if the pre-existing configuration files are incompatible.
        * Makefile.static: Cosmetic changes at the top comments.
        * Makefile.static: Renamed 'to-where' to 'print-destinations'.
        * Makefile.static (dist): cd into $(builddir) and use relative paths
            when making the tar.

2016-01-06      Oskar Skog      <oskar.skog.finland@gmail.com>
    0.0.21
        * Makefile.static: Silence is golden. Use more variables.
            New target: uninstall
            New target: to-where
            Made the dist target work on FreeBSD.

        * anonymine_engine.py: Wrote some doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py: Removed `maindoc`.
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine): `interface.anykey_cont` is no
            longer required.  It is still used if it exists.
        * Makefile.static: Don't rename /etc/anonymine/initcfg to
            /etc/anonymine/enginecfg as this will cause confusion when
            combined with $(DESTDIR) and is not needed.
        * Makefile.static: $(PRE_INSTALL) and $(NORMAL_INSTALL) have been
            inserted.
    0.0.19
        * ChangeLog (0.0.17): Oops: It was modified, but I forgot to save.
        * : "initcfg" has been renamed to "enginecfg" to allow for more
            directives in the future.
        * anonymine.py: Global replace "initcfg" with "enginecfg".
        * anonymine.py (play_game), anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.__init__):
            Send the configuration file's path as a positional argument
            instead.
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): -i to -e.
        * anonymine.py (play_game): Corrected the doc-string's description
            of enginecfg. (Previously specific to field initialization.)
        * Makefile.static: Attempt to rename a pre-existing "initcfg" to
            "enginecfg"
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Improved help text for the -e and -c
            options.

    0.0.17
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.leave): Set the SIGWINCH handler to
            SIG_IGN, to fix a bug.  (Documented in the source.)
        * test.py: Added function `bug1` to demonstrate the bug that has been
            fixed.
        * Makefile.static: New files: "BUGS" and "portability".
        * anonymine.py:
            * The "time" module wasn't used.
            * "traceback" WILL exist; no need for try/except.
            * "signal" WILL exist; no need for try/except.
            * The warning about "argparse" not being available was hard to
              read as it was on the top of the screen.
    0.0.16
        * ChangeLog (0.0.15): str.format is new in Python 2.6, no lower version
            possible.
        * cursescfg: A_BLINK was annoying on the cursor for square fields.
        * anonymine.py (ask): Quit immediately on ^C, don't ask.
        * configure.py: Check dependencies.
        * INSTALL: Mention dependencies.
        * Makefile.static: Print out MODULES_OTHERVER on make install.
        * Makefile.static: Changed $(DEST) to $(DESTDIR) in many places.

2016-01-03      Oskar Skog      <oskar.skog.finland@gmail.com>
    0.0.15
        * anonymine.py, anonymine_engine.py, anonymine_fields.py, configure.py:
        * install-cfg, initcfg:
            Put an index in all '{}'s in all format strings to be compatible
            with Python 2.6.
        * anonymine.py: Allow the modules "argparse" and "traceback" to be
            missing.
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Implemented dummy mode when argparse
            is unavailable.
    0.0.14
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.__init__): Minimal allowed resolution is
            now 10x8 for hexagonal fields.
        * anonymine.py: Gave the doc-strings a summary line. (PEP 0257)
        * install-cfg: BUGFIX: Forgot to import os.
    0.0.13
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Extended the main doc-string.
        * anonymine.py, anonymine.py (maindoc): Added a doc-string for the
            whole module, currently empty.
        * anonymine.py (ask, convert_param): Wrote the doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py (convert_params): Renamed to convert_param as it takes
            one parameter.
        * anonymine.py (convert_param):
            * Allow '4', '6', '8' and 'hexagonal' as `s` when
                paramtype == "gametype".
            * Moved the 'yesno' block to the top as it is probably the most
                usable for re-use.
            * Improved the Easter egg for paramtype=='dimension'.
    0.0.12
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Wrote the remaining doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.print_hex, curses_game.print_square):
            The area mentioned in the doc-strings accidentally included the
            bottom line (currently used for the flags left text).
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Replaced `self.coordinate` with
            `self.cursor` to remove some confusion.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.print_hex): Made the doc-string a
            raw string due to the backslashes.
        * ChangeLog (0.0.9): `convert_params` did already exist, the new thing
            was 'reverse-minecount'.
    0.0.11
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Wrote some doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py: Fixed the "printing of traceback without fucking
            up terminal".
            Previous behaviour: complain about curses.endwin() before
            initialization.

2016-01-03      Oskar Skog      <oskar.skog.finland@gmail.com>
    0.0.10
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Changed "epilog" to "description" in the
            call to `argparse.ArgumentParser` as it would be more appropriate.
        * anonymine.py (play_game, arg_input, main): Clearer handling of
            the configuration filepath parameters.
        * anonymine.py (main, play_game, user_input, arg_input):
            Created the doc-strings.
    0.0.9
        * anonymine.py (game_engine), anonymine_engine.py: Moved the
            game engine class into its own module.

        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Not inherited from the game_engine class.
        * anonymine.py: Added global GAME_FILENAME to clean up some more code.
        * anonymine.py (user_input, convert_params): Added 'reverse-minecount'
            to the function `convert_params` to fix bug in `user_input`.
            The default number of mines is now the actual default (at the time
            20%) rather than the hard coded 16%.
2016-01-02      Oskar Skog      <oskar.skog.finland@gmail.com>
    0.0.8
        * configure.py, Makefile.static: The modules will now be installed
            for both versions of Python.
        * Makefile.static: Added quotation to prevent disaster if someone
            puts spaces in srcdir, builddir or DESTDIR.
    0.0.7
        * anonymine_solver.py, anonymine_fields.py, anonymine.py: Wrapped each
            call to `filter` in a list, due to incompatibilities with Python 3.
            run2, run6 and run9 in test.py now works in Py3.  Further resizing
            tests should be done.  Modules only available in the default
            version of Python.
    0.0.6
        * anonymine.py (user_input), cursescfg: Provide in-game documentation
            on the key bindings.
        * Makefile.static (install):
            Moved the configuration installation lines higher up to prevent
            installing something that can't use the available configuration.
    0.0.5
        * cursescfg: Various improvements including compacting, documenting,
            notifying about potential future incompatibility and rethinking
            hexagonal steering.
    0.0.4
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.message): Bugfix: messages will now
            be split into many lines if it doesn't fit in one.
            Previous behaviour: crash.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.__init__): Limit screen sizes to a minimum
            of 7 columns and 4 rows.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.output): Always decrease the available
            height, not only when the flags left message doesn't fit.
            Seems to fix a resizing bug that traces to curses_game.print_char.
    0.0.3
        * Makefile, Makefile.static, configure, configure.py:
            A simple configure script has been written.
            Manual modification of the Makefile no longer needed.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match the current installation procedure.
    0.0.2
        * Makefile, install-cfg: Created a small python script to prevent
            overwriting potentially modified configuration files.
            Added the rule "overwrite-cfg" to the Makefile.
        * Makefile: @ed out all lines; added echo(1)es to tell what is being
            done.
        * INSTALL: Mentioning the install-cfg script and the overwrite-cfg
            rule.
    0.0.1
        * Makefile: Avoiding the use of `install -t` as it doesn't work on
            at least FreeBSD.
