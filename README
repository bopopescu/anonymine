Anonymine is a curses mode minesweeper that checks if the fields actually are
solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, Anonymine has a few other features:
    - Three different field types
        - von Neumann (4 neighbors)
        - hexagonal (6 neighbors)
        - traditional (8 neighbors)
    - There's a highscores table for the losers too.
    - The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.

You can also try it over SSH as anonymine@anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:2222 with
password "anonymine".
Ie. User "anonymine", password "anonymine", host "anonymine-demo.oskog97.com",
port "2222".

    - INSTALL for installation instructions. (./configure; make; make install)


Tested platforms
================

    The dependencies are:
    (Python 3.x || Python >= 2.6) && curses mod. && (unix || argparse mod.)
    less(1) is recommended.
    
    The argparse module is needed for Anonymine to take command line options.
    The configuration files can be specified with the -e and -c command line
    options to override the default locations which happen to be unix paths.
    
    Note that Python 2.6, 3.0 and 3.1 are not expected to have the
    module "argparse".
    
    CPython 2.6.4 is lowest version of Python that has been tested.
