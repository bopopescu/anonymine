Anonymine is a curses mode minesweeper that checks if the fields actually are
solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

The game doesn't have a real name yet; suggestions are welcome.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, anonymine:
    - can use traditional Moore neighbourhoods (8 neighbours per cell),
    - a hexagonal field (6 neighbours per cell)
    - or von Neumann neighbourhoods (4 neighbours per cell).
  
    - The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.


You can also try it over SSH at
ssh://anonymine:anonymine@anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:2222 ie:
User "anonymine", password "anonymine", host "anonymine-demo.oskog97.com",
port "2222".
Or at http://anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:8080/ with the same username and
password.

Tested platforms
================

    The dependencies are:
    (Python 3.x || Python >= 2.6) && curses mod. && (unix || argparse mod.)
    
    The argparse module is needed for Anonymine to take command line options.
    The configuration files can be specified with the -e and -c command line
    options to override the default locations which happen to be unix paths.
        
    Note that Python 2.6, 3.0 and 3.1 are not expected to have the
    module "argparse".
        
    CPython 2.6.6 is lowest version of Python that has been tested.
