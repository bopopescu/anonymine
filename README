Anonymine is a curses mode minesweeper that checks if the fields actually are
solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

The game doesn't have a real name yet; suggestions are welcome.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, anonymine:
    * can use traditional Moore neighbourhoods (8 neighbours per cell),
    * a hexagonal field (6 neighbours per cell)
    * or von Neumann neighbourhoods (4 neighbours per cell).
    
    * The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.

Untested platforms
==================

    * Cygwin  (Tested, unknown version)
    * Mac OS X
    * CPython on native Windrugs; Is there a "curses" module and does it work?


Tested platforms
================
    
    This is a list of platforms on which Anonymine works.
    
    Note that Python 2.6, 3.0 and 3.1 are not expected to have the
    module "argparse".
    
    CPython 2.6.6 is lowest tested.
