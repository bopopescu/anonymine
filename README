Anonymine is a curses mode minesweeper that checks if the fields actually are
solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

The game doesn't have a real name yet; suggestions are welcome.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, anonymine:
- can use traditional Moore neighbourhoods (8 neighbours per cell),
- a hexagonal field (6 neighbours per cell)
- or von Neumann neighbourhoods (4 neighbours per cell).
  
- The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.
