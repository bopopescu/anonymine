Anonymine is a curses mode (text based) minesweeper that checks if the fields
actually are solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, Anonymine has a few other features:
    - Three different field types
        - von Neumann (4 neighbors)
        - hexagonal (6 neighbors)
        - traditional (8 neighbors)
    - There's a highscores table for the losers too.
    - The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.

You can also try it over SSH as play@anonymine-demo.oskog97.com port 2222.

Software & hardware requirements
================================

    Required software
        - Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.x
        - The "curses" module (Python)
        - The "argparse" module (Python) or a unix-like operating system [*1,2]
    
    *1 The argparse module is needed for Anonymine to take commandline options.
    The configuration files can be specified with the -e and -c command line
    options to override the default locations which happen to be unix paths.
    
    *2 Note that Python 2.6, 3.0 and 3.1 are not expected to have the
    module "argparse".
    
    Software recommendations
        - unix-like operating system or compatibility layer. fork(2) is
          required for utilizing multiple CPU cores.
        - The less(1) pager, for displaying the highscores table.
        - PyPy (You'll need to set MODULES_DIR manually at ./configure)
    
    Hardware requirements
        - Fast CPU and fast RAM (Multiple cores can be used by Anonymine.)
        - Fan for cooling the CPU
        - Disk:
            - 2 MiB for tarball downloads
            - 8 MiB for git clones
        - RAM usage:
            - Lesser than 16 MiB plus 24 MiB per logical CPU (core) for CPython
            - Lesser than 96 MiB plus 128 MiB per logical CPU (core) for PyPy
            - 96 MiB (total) should be enough for CPython and FreeBSD
        - Network not required, except for downloading.


Tested platforms
================

    CPython 2.6.4 is lowest version of Python that has been tested.
