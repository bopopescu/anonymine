Anonymine is a curses mode minesweeper that checks if the fields actually are
solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

The game doesn't have a real name yet; suggestions are welcome.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, anonymine:
- can use traditional Moore neighbourhoods (8 neighbours per cell),
- a hexagonal field (6 neighbours per cell)
- or von Neumann neighbourhoods (4 neighbours per cell).
  
- The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.


You can also try it over SSH at ssh://anonymine:anonymine@oskog97.com:2222
ie: User "anonymine", password "anonymine", host "oskog97.com", port "2222".
Or using my [shellinabox server](http://oskog97.com:8080/) with the same
username and password.

You can find screenshots and more at

Tested platforms
================

The dependencies are:
(Python 3.x || Python >= 2.6) && "curses" module && (unix || "argparse" module) 
    
Note that Python 2.6, 3.0 and 3.1 are not expected to have the
module "argparse".
    
CPython 2.6.6 is lowest version of Python that has been tested.
