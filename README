================================================================================

Anonymine is a curses mode (text based) minesweeper that checks if the fields
actually are solvable without guessing and has a few other features.

Apart from being solvable without guessing, Anonymine has a few other features:
    - Three different field types
        - von Neumann (4 neighbors)
        - hexagonal (6 neighbors)
        - traditional (8 neighbors)
    - There's a highscores table for the losers too.
    - The anonymine_solver module can also be used to "measure the difficulty"
      of a field.

You can also try it over SSH as play@anonymine-demo.oskog97.com port 2222.
